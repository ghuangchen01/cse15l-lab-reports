<p>cd command lines:</p>

<p>Screen Shot:</p>

<br/>
<p>The working directory was home/</p>
<p>There were no result so I didn't take a screen shot to it, the reason it is no result is because cd command means change directory but we didn't specify which directory we want to change to so there is no result.</p>

<br/>
<p>The working directory was home/</p>
<p>The output shows on the next line before the commands, the current working directory changed to the directory called lecture1. The output is not an error and it is what we expect to get, we use command line change directory to lecture1 and now we are at lecture1.</p>

<br/>
<p>The working directory was home/</p>
<p>I got the output as "bash: cd: lecture1/messages/en-us.txt: Not a directory" and this is because I use a file as an argument, cd is for directory. The output is an error because we want to change the current directory to the argument directory but our argument is not a directory so it shows error output telling us is not able to change.</p>
